class Mode:
    """A mode is something that is activated (entered in) and deactivated
    (exited from). Each Mode instance is created with a set of Method classes,
    and each one of the Methods may be used to activate the Mode. There are
    multiple Methods for each Mode as there are multiple different operating
    systems, platforms and desktop environments which might need different
    activation strategy, but for a single system only one Method would be
    enough for Mode activation. The rest are typically just for supporting
    other platforms/DEs/etc.

    Modes are implemented as context managers, and user code runs when the mode
    is active. When the mode is active, there is a possibility to run a
    heartbeat (implemented in a future version).

    **Purpose of Mode**:

    * Provide the main API of wakepy for the user
    * Provide `__enter__` and `__exit__`  for fulfilling the `context manager
      protocol <https://peps.python.org/pep-0343/>`_
    * Provide easy way to define list of Methods to be used for entering a mode

    Modes are usually created with a factory function like
    :func:`keep.presenting <wakepy.keep.presenting>` or  :func:`keep.running
    <wakepy.keep.running>`, but using the :class:`~wakepy.Mode` separately
    can be used for more fine-grained control.

    ----------

        names must be unique and must be part of the `methods`.
    name:
        Name of the Mode. Used for communication to user, logging and in
        error messages (can be "any string" which makes sense to you).
        Optional.
    on_fail: "error" | "warn" | "pass" | Callable
        Determines what to do in case mode activation fails. Valid options

        "error", raises wakepy.ActivationError. Is selected "warn", issues
        warning. If "pass", does nothing. If `on_fail` is a callable, it
        must take one positional argument: result, which is an instance of
        ActivationResult. The ActivationResult contains more detailed
        information about the activation process.

    """Take an unordered list of Methods and sort them by priority using the
    methods_priority and automatic ordering. The methods_priority is used to
    define groups of priority (sets of methods). The automatic ordering part is
    used to order the methods *within* each priority group. In particular, all
    methods supported by the current platform are placed first, and all
    supported methods are then ordered alphabetically (ignoring case).

    Parameters
    ----------
    methods:
        The list of Methods to sort.
    methods_priority:
        Optional priority order, which is a list of method names (strings) or
        sets of method names (sets of strings). An asterisk ('*') may be used
        for "all the rest methods". None is same as ['*'].

    Returns
    -------
    sorted_methods:
        The input `methods` sorted with priority, highest priority first.

    Example
    -------
    Assuming: Current platform is Linux.

    >>> methods = [LinuxA, LinuxB, LinuxC, MultiPlatformA, WindowsA]
    >>> get_prioritized_methods(
    >>>    methods,
    >>>    methods_priority=[{"WinA", "LinuxB"}, "*"],
    >>> )
    [LinuxB, WindowsA, LinuxA, LinuxC, MultiPlatformA]

    Explanation:

    WindowsA and LinuxB were given high priority, but since the current
    platform is Linux, LinuxB was prioritized to be before WindowsA.

    The asterisk ('*') is converted to a set of rest of the methods:
    {"LinuxA", "LinuxC", "MultiPlatformA"}, and those are then
    automatically ordered. As all of them support Linux, the result is
    just the methods sorted alphabetically. The asterisk in the end is
    optional; it is added to the end of `methods_priority` if missing.
