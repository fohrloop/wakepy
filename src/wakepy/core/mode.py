class Mode:
    """A mode is something that is activated (entered in) and deactivated
    (exited from). Each Mode instance is created with a set of Method classes,
    and each one of the Methods may be used to activate the Mode. There are
    multiple Methods for each Mode as there are multiple different operating
    systems, platforms and desktop environments which might need different
    activation strategy, but for a single system only one Method would be
    enough for Mode activation. The rest are typically just for supporting
    other platforms/DEs/etc.

    Modes are implemented as context managers, and user code runs when the mode
    is active. When the mode is active, there is a possibility to run a
    heartbeat (implemented in a future version).

    **Purpose of Mode**:

    * Provide the main API of wakepy for the user
    * Provide `__enter__` and `__exit__`  for fulfilling the `context manager
      protocol <https://peps.python.org/pep-0343/>`_
    * Provide easy way to define list of Methods to be used for entering a mode

    Modes are usually created with a factory function like
    :func:`keep.presenting <wakepy.keep.presenting>` or  :func:`keep.running
    <wakepy.keep.running>`, but using the :class:`~wakepy.Mode` separately
    can be used for more fine-grained control.

    Parameters
    ----------

        names must be unique and must be part of the `methods`.
    name:
        Name of the Mode. Used for communication to user, logging and in
        error messages (can be "any string" which makes sense to you).
        Optional.
    on_fail: "error" | "warn" | "pass" | Callable
        Determines what to do in case mode activation fails. Valid options
        are: "error", "warn", "pass" and a callable. If the option is
        "error", raises :class:`~wakepy.ActivationError`. Is selected "warn",
        issues a warning. If "pass", does nothing. If ``on_fail`` is a
        callable, it must take one positional argument: result, which is an
        instance of :class:`ActivationResult`. The ActivationResult contains
        more detailed information about the activation process.
    dbus_adapter:
        For using a custom dbus-adapter. Optional. If not given, the
