    Notes
    -----

    - This function cannot return any Modes from other threads. This means that
      even if you have entered a Mode in an another thread, but not in the
      current thread, this function will return ``None``
    - You may access the current :class:`Mode` instance from anywhere
      throughout the call stack, as long you are in the same thread and
      context.
    - You only need the :func:`current_mode` if you're using the decorator
      syntax, or if you're checking the mode within a function which is lower
      in the call stack.
    - Internally, a `ContextVar <https://docs.python.org/3/library/\
      contextvars.html#contextvars.ContextVar>`_. is used to store the
      current Mode instance for the current thread and context.

    Returns
    -------
    current_mode: Mode | None
        The current Mode instance for the thread and context. ``None``, if not
        entered in any Mode.


    Examples
    --------
    **Decorator syntax**: You may use this function to get the current
    :class:`Mode` instance, when using the :ref:`decorator syntax \\

    current :class:`Mode` instance in a function which is lower in the call
    stack, like this::
