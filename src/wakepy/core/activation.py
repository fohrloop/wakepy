"""This module defines functions which may be used in the activation and

Most important functions
------------------------
activate_method(method:Method) -> MethodActivationResult
    Activate a mode using a single Method
get_prioritized_methods
    Prioritize of collection of Methods

Most important classes

    --------------------
    These are the three possible statuses from attempts to use either
    enter_mode() or heartbeat():

    M: Missing implementation
    F: Failed attempt
    S: Succesful attempt

    There are total of 7 different outcomes (3*3 possibilities, minus two from
    not checking heartbeat if enter_mode fails), marked as
    {enter_mode_outcome}{heartbeat_outcome}; MS means enter_mode() was missing
    implementation and using heartbeat() was successful.

    All the possible combinations which may occur are
