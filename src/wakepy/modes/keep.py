    Create a wakepy Mode (a context manager / decorator) for keeping
    programs running.

    ➡️ :ref:`Documentation of keep.running mode. <keep-running-mode>` ⬅️

    Parameters
    ----------
    methods: list, tuple or set of str
        The names of :ref:`Methods <wakepy-methods>` to select from the
        keep.running mode; a "whitelist" filter. Means "use these and only
        these Methods". Any Methods in `methods` but not in the keep.running
        mode will raise a ValueError. Cannot be used same time with `omit`.
        Optional.
    omit: list, tuple or set of str or None
        The names of :ref:`Methods <wakepy-methods>`  to remove from the
        keep.running mode; a "blacklist" filter. Any Method in `omit` but not
        in the keep.running mode will be silently ignored. Cannot be used same
        time with `methods`. Optional.
    methods_priority: list[str | set[str]]
        The priority order for the methods to be used when entering the
        keep.running mode. You may use this parameter to force or suggest the
        order in which Methods are used. Any methods not explicitly supported
        by the current platform will automatically be unused (no need to add
        them here). The format is a list[str | set[str]], where each
        string is a Method name. Any method within a set will have equal
        user-given priority, and they are prioritized with the automatic
        prioritization rules. The first item in the list has the highest
        priority. All method names must be unique and must be part of the
        keep.running Mode.

        The asterisk ('*') can be used to mean "all other methods"
        and may occur only once in the priority order, and cannot be part of a
        set. If asterisk is not part of the `methods_priority`, it will be
        added as the last element automatically.
    on_fail: "error" | "warn" | "pass" | Callable
        Determines what to do in case mode activation fails. Valid options
        are: "error", "warn", "pass" and a callable. If the option is
        "error", raises :class:`~wakepy.ActivationError`. Is selected "warn",
        issues a :class:`~wakepy.ActivationWarning`. If "pass", does nothing.
        If ``on_fail`` is a callable, it must take one positional argument:
        result, which is an instance of :class:`~wakepy.ActivationResult`. The
        ActivationResult contains more detailed information about the
        activation process.
    dbus_adapter: class or sequence of classes
        Optional argument which can be used to define a custom DBus adapter.
        If given, should be a subclass of :class:`~wakepy.DBusAdapter`, or a
        list of such.

    Returns
    -------
    Mode | func
        If not used as a decorator, returns a context manager :class:`Mode \\
        <wakepy.core.mode.Mode>` instance. If used as a decorator, returns a
        function that automatically enters the :ref:`keep.running \\
        <keep-running-mode>` mode when called (this automatically creates
        a new context manager and uses it).

    Examples
    --------
    Using the :ref:`decorator syntax <decorator-syntax>`::

        from wakepy import keep

        @keep.running
        def long_running_function():
            # do something that takes a long time.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0.0

        The :ref:`decorator syntax <decorator-syntax>` for `keep.running`
        was added in version 1.0.0.

    Using the :ref:`context manager syntax <context-manager-syntax>`::

        from wakepy import keep

        with keep.running() as m:
            # do something that takes a long time.
