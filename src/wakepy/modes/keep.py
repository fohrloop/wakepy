    ➡️ :ref:`Documentation of keep.running mode. <keep-running-mode>` ⬅️

    Parameters
    ----------
    methods: list, tuple or set of str
        The names of Methods to select from the keep.running mode; a
        "whitelist" filter. Means "use these and only these Methods". Any
        Methods in `methods` but not in the keep.running mode will raise a
        ValueError. Cannot be used same time with `omit`. Optional.
    omit: list, tuple or set of str or None
        The names of Methods to remove from the keep.running mode; a
        "blacklist" filter. Any Method in `omit` but not in the keep.running
        mode will be silently ignored. Cannot be used same time with
        `methods`. Optional.
    methods_priority: list[str | set[str]]
        The priority order for the methods to be used when entering the
        keep.running mode. You may use this parameter to force or suggest the
        order in which Methods are used. Any methods not explicitly supported
        by the current platform will automatically be unused (no need to add
        them here). The format is a list[str | set[str]], where each
        string is a Method name. Any method within a set will have equal
        user-given priority, and they are prioritized with the automatic
        prioritization rules. The first item in the list has the highest
        priority. All method names must be unique and must be part of the
        keep.running Mode.

        The asterisk ('*') can be used to mean "all other methods"
        and may occur only once in the priority order, and cannot be part of a
        set. If asterisk is not part of the `methods_priority`, it will be
        added as the last element automatically.
    on_fail: "error" | "warn" | "pass" | Callable
        Determines what to do in case mode activation fails. Valid options
        are: "error", "warn", "pass" and a callable. If the option is
        "error", raises :class:`~wakepy.ActivationError`. Is selected "warn",
        issues a warning. If "pass", does nothing. If ``on_fail`` is a
        callable, it must take one positional argument: result, which is an
        instance of :class:`~wakepy.ActivationResult`. The ActivationResult
        contains more detailed information about the activation process.
    dbus_adapter: class or sequence of classes
        Optional argument which can be used to define a custom DBus adapter.
        If given, should be a subclass of :class:`~wakepy.DBusAdapter`, or a
        list of such.

    Returns
    -------
    keep_running_mode: Mode
        The context manager for keeping a system running.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> with keep.running() as k:
