        Motivation:
        -----------
        When running on CI system, wakepy might fail to acquire an inhibitor
        lock just because there is no Desktop Environment running. In these
        cases, it might be useful to just tell with an environment variable
        that wakepy should fake the successful inhibition anyway. Faking the
        success is done after every other method is tried (and failed).
