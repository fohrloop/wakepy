# Changelog 

## [0.7.1] (2023-06-11)
### Fixed
- `keep.running` and `keep.presenting` return an object `m` with `success` value of `True`.
   
## [0.7.0] (2023-06-11)
### Added
- New API: `keep.running()` and `keep.presenting()` context managers. These are currently simple wrappers of the old methods but the internals will be re-written in a future version. 
- The context managers now return the result of the action, `m`. Users may check with `m.success` if changing the mode was succesful.
- Possibility to fake succesful change of mode with `WAKEPY_FAKE_SUCCESS` (for CI / tests).
### Fixed
- No exceptions anymore on import-time. All exceptions should be handled now gracefully, and user is informed if switching to a `keep.running` or `keep.presenting` mode failed.
  
### Deprecated
- Old Python API:  The `keepawake()`, `set_keepawake` and `unset_keepwake`. These will be removed in a future version of wakepy. Use `keep.running()`or `keep.presenting()`, instead.
- The `-s, --keep-screen-awake` option of the `wakepy` CLI command. Use `-p, --presentation ` option, instead.
