# ‚è∞üò¥ wakepy

Cross-platform wakelock / keep-awake / stay-awake written in Python.

## Supports
- Python: 3.7 to 3.13
- OS: Windows, Linux and macOS

## What it can do?

Wakepy has two main modes:
1. **`keep.running`**: keep your tasks & CPU running even if you lock your session and turn screenlock on; This mode prevents your system from going to sleep automatically (*e.g.* for training machine learning models, video encoding, web scraping, ...)
2. **`keep.presenting`**: same as `keep.running` but keep also the screen awake and prevent automatic screen lock & screensaver  (*e.g.* for showing a video, updating dashboard, monitoring apps, ...)

> Wakepy API is still experimental üöß

> Since wakepy is still 0.x.x, the API might change without further notice from
> one release to another. After that, breaking changes should occur only part of
> a major release (e.g. 1.x.x -> 2.0.0).
