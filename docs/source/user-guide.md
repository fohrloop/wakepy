# User Guide

Wakepy main Python API is are the wakepy [Modes](#wakepy-modes), which are states that are activated and deactivated and which keep your system awake. The method for activating the mode depends on your platform (among other things) and is determined by the used [Method](#wakepy-methods).  For example [keep.presenting](#keep-presenting-mode) mode is implemented by [org.gnome.SessionManager](#org-gnome-sessionmanager) for Linux with GNOME DE, [SetThreadExecutionState](#windows-stes) for Windows and [caffeinate](#macos-caffeinate) for MacOS. In most cases, wakepy does nothing but calls an executable (caffeinate), a DLL function call (SetThreadExecutionState) or a D-Bus method (org.gnome.SessionManager). Wakepy helps in this by providing a coherent API which should just workâ„¢ on any system. Or, at least that is the vision of wakepy.


## Entering a wakepy.Mode

The wakepy modes are implemented as context managers of type {class}`wakepy.Mode`. The available convenience wrappers for creating a Mode are {func}`keep.running() <wakepy.keep.running>` and {func}`keep.presenting() <wakepy.keep.presenting>`. These are used with the `with` statement:

```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep

with keep.running():
    # Do something that takes a long time. The system may start screensaver
    # / screenlock or blank the screen, but CPU will keep running.
```

 When entering the context, a {class}`~wakepy.Mode` instance (`m`) is returned: 

```{code-block} python
with keep.running() as m:
    ...
```

The Mode has following important attributes:

- {attr}`m.active <wakepy.Mode.active>`: `True`, if entering mode was successful. Can be [faked in CI](./tests-and-ci.md#wakepy_fake_success).
- {attr}`m.active_method <wakepy.Mode.active_method>`: The name of the *active* method. Will be `None` after mode is deactivated.
- {attr}`m.used_method <wakepy.Mode.used_method>`: The name of the used method. Will not be reset to `None` after deactivation.
- {attr}`m.activation_result <wakepy.Mode.activation_result>`: An {class}`~wakepy.ActivationResult` instance which gives more detailed information about the activation process.

## Which wakepy Method was used?
```{versionadded} 0.8.0
```

When you would like to check *how* exactly did wakepy do what you asked it to,
you can check the used method from the {class}`Mode <wakepy.Mode>` instance.

**Example**

```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep

with keep.running() as m:
    print('active_method:', m.active_method)
    print('used_method:', m.used_method)

print('--------')
print('active_method:', m.active_method)
print('used_method:', m.used_method)
```

Example output:

```
active_method: org.gnome.SessionManager
used_method: org.gnome.SessionManager
--------
active_method: None
used_method: org.gnome.SessionManager
```

```{seealso}
{attr}`Mode.active_method <wakepy.Mode.active_method>`,  {attr}`Mode.used_method <wakepy.Mode.used_method>`
```

## Controlling the on-fail action
```{versionadded} 0.8.0
```

Wakepy follows the [Zen on Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/):

> Errors should never pass silently.  
> Unless explicitly silenced.

and therefore by default if a mode cannot be activated, an {class}`~wakepy.ActivationError` is raised. The wakepy Modes also take an `on_fail` input argument which may be used to alter the behavior.


### on-fail actions

| `on_fail`                | What happens? |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| "error"  (default)    | Raises an {class}`~wakepy.ActivationError`        |
| "warn"  | Issues an {class}`~wakepy.ActivationWarning` |
| "pass"  | Does nothing |
| Callable | The callable is called with one argument: the result of the activation which is <br> a instance of {class}`~wakepy.ActivationResult`. The call occurs before the with block is entered. |


```{seealso}
{class}`Mode.__init__() <wakepy.Mode>` `on_fail` argument.
```

#### Example: Notify user with a custom callable

This is what you could do if you want to inform the user that the activation of the mode was not successful, but still want to continue to run the task:

```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep, ActivationResult

def react_on_failure(result: ActivationResult):
    print(f'Failed to keep system awake using {result.mode_name} mode')

def run_long_task():
    print('Running a long task')

with keep.running(methods=[], on_fail=react_on_failure):
    print('started')
    run_long_task()
```

- The `on_fail` parameter to {func}`keep.running() <wakepy.keep.running>` is a callable which gets called with an {class}`~wakepy.ActivationResult` when the activation of the mode fails.
- Here we use empty list in `methods` to force failure

Example output:

```
Failed to keep system awake using keep.running mode
started
Running a long task
```

#### Example: Notify user and exit

This is what you could do if you want to inform the user that the activation of the mode was not successful, and then exit from the with block:

```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep, ActivationResult, ModeExit

def react_on_failure(result: ActivationResult):
    print(f'Failed to keep system awake using {result.mode_name} mode')

def run_long_task():
    print('Running a long task')

with keep.running(methods=[], on_fail=react_on_failure) as m:
    print('started')

    if not m.active:
        print('exiting')
        raise ModeExit

    run_long_task()
```

- The difference to the previous example is the {class}`ModeExit <wakepy.ModeExit>` which is used to exit the with block, if the {attr}`Mode.active <wakepy.Mode.active>` is not `True`.


Example output (notice that `run_long_task` was never called):

```
Failed to keep system awake using keep.running mode
started
exiting
```

(how-to-white-or-blacklist-methods)=
## Controlling the Methods to be tried

```{versionadded} 0.8.0
```

Wakepy tries in order a list of different [Methods](#wakepy-methods). By default this is of methods are all the Methods which implement the selected wakepy Mode. If you do not want to try all the methods, you can 

- Blacklist methods with the `omit` parameter
- Whitelist methods with the `methods` parameter

Only either `omit` or `methods` may be given (not both).

### Example: whitelisting methods

This would try the methods called `org.gnome.SessionManager` and `SomeOtherMethod`, but never any other methods. Note that the order is *not* defined by the whitelist.

```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep

with keep.running(methods=['org.gnome.SessionManager', 'SomeOtherMethod']):
    ...
```

### Example: blacklisting methods

This would *never* try the methods called `org.gnome.SessionManager` and `SomeOtherMethod`, but only any other methods implementing the selected Mode.

```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep

with keep.running(omit=['org.gnome.SessionManager', 'SomeOtherMethod']):
    ...
```



```{seealso}
`omit` and `methods` parameter of {meth}`Mode.from_name() <wakepy.Mode.from_name>`, {func}`keep.running() <wakepy.keep.running>`  and {func}`keep.presenting() <wakepy.keep.presenting>`
```

(how-to-control-order-of-methods)=
## Controlling the order of Methods to be tried

```{versionadded} 0.8.0
```

To control the order of the methods to be tried, you may use the `methods_priority` argument. The argument should be a list of method names or sets of method names. Each item in the list is considered as "equal priority" and wakepy's automatic logic will order the methods within the sets. An asterisk (`*`) may be used to denote "any other methods".


### Example: prioritizing methods

This would put `MethodA` and `MethodB` to be in the highest priority group, and wakepy's automatic prioritization logic would determine which one of the methods should be tried first. It would also put the `MethodF` to have the least priority and that method would only be tried after trying any other methods have failed.

```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep

with keep.running(methods_priority=[{"MethodA", "MethodB"}, "*", "MethodF"]):
    ...
```


```{seealso}
`methods_priority` parameter of {meth}`Mode.from_name() <wakepy.Mode.from_name>`, {func}`keep.running() <wakepy.keep.running>`  and {func}`keep.presenting() <wakepy.keep.presenting>`
```

```{admonition} experimental feature
:class: note

The `methods_priority` is still an experimental feature and may change or be removed without further notice.
