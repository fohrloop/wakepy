# Quickstart


## Installing

To install wakepy from PyPI, run

```{code-block} text
pip install wakepy
```

## Basic Usage

### Long running tasks

If you want to keep a long task running, but do not want to prevent screen from locking and/or blanking, you can use the [`keep.running`](#keep-running-mode) function which returns a context manager:


```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep

with keep.running():
    # Do something that takes a long time. The system may start screensaver
    # / screenlock, but CPU will keep running.
```


### Keeping screen awake
If you want to prevent screen lock and screen blank *in addition to* keeping CPU awake, use the [`keep.presenting`](#keep-presenting-mode) function which returns a context manager:


```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep

with keep.presenting():
    # Do something that takes a long time and requires the screen to be awake
```



```{admonition} Wakepy API is still experimental ðŸš§
:class: note

Since wakepy is still 0.x.x, the API might change without further notice from
one release to another. After that, breaking changes should occur only part of
a major release (e.g. 1.x.x -> 2.0.0).
