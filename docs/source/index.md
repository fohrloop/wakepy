# Overview

## What is wakepy?

Wakepy is a package with an Python API and a CLI tool for *keeping a system awake*. Namely:

‚åõ **Keeping CPU awake**:  For long running tasks. Inhibit the automatic, timer based sleep or suspend action, but allow screenlock and screensaver turning on and monitor turning off. (See: <a href="https://wakepy.readthedocs.io/stable/modes.html#keep-running-mode">keep.running</a>)

üñ•Ô∏è **Keeping screen awake**:  For long running tasks which require also the screen on and screenlock and screensaver inhibited. (See: <a href="https://wakepy.readthedocs.io/stable/modes.html#keep-presenting-mode">keep.presenting</a>)


## Supported platforms

Wakepy may keep the following systems awake. ‚åõ: <a href="https://wakepy.readthedocs.io/stable/modes.html#keep-running-mode">keep.running</a> mode, üñ•Ô∏è:<a href="https://wakepy.readthedocs.io/stable/modes.html#keep-presenting-mode">keep.presenting</a> mode.

## Installing

Wakepy supports CPython 3.7 to 3.13, and may be installed with

```
pip install wakepy
```

To get the `wakepy` [CLI command](#cli-api) working, you might need to restart the shell / terminal application.

## Why wakepy?
Here's some reasons why you might want to consider using wakepy:

üõ°Ô∏è For security reasons
: When you don't want to use a technique which keeps the screen awake and disables the automatic screen lock. I.e. you *only* want to disable the automatic suspend. 

ü¶∏ You need a cross-platform solution
: Same code works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

‚öôÔ∏è You want to have more control
: It is possible to whitelist or blacklist the used wakepy Methods. It is also possible to prioritize them and define a on-fail action in case activating a wakepy mode fails.

‚úÇÔ∏è You want to keep the amount of dependencies low
: If you're running wakepy on Linux,  [jeepney](https://jeepney.readthedocs.io/) is required for D-Bus based methods. On Python 3.7,  [typing-extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/) is needed for typing. Otherwise: wakepy has no python dependencies.

‚öñÔ∏è Package needs to have a permissive licence
: Wakepy is licenced under permissive [MIT License](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).



## Command line interface (CLI)

To keep system from sleeping, run

```
wakepy
```

For presentation mode, add `-p` flag. See also: [CLI API](#cli-api)

## Basic usage within Python

In the simplest case, keeping a system running long running task with wakepy would be in python (See: [`keep.running`](#keep-running-mode)):

```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep

with keep.running():
    # Do something that takes a long time. The system may start screensaver
    # / screenlock or blank the screen, but CPU will keep running.
```

If you want to *also* prevent screen lock and screen blank, use the [`keep.presenting`](#keep-presenting-mode) mode:


```{code-block} python
from wakepy import keep

with keep.presenting():
    # Do something that takes a long time and requires the screen to be awake
```


```{admonition} Next Steps
:class: seealso

See the [User Guide](#user-guide) and the available wakepy [Modes](#wakepy-modes) and [Methods](#wakepy-methods)
```
```{admonition} Wakepy API is still experimental üöß
:class: note

Since wakepy is still 0.x.x, the API might change without further notice from
one release to another. After that, breaking changes should occur only part of
a major release (e.g. 1.x.x -> 2.0.0).
