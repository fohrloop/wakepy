# Changelog

## wakepy 0.9.1
üóìÔ∏è 2024-06-04

### üêû Bug fixes
- The [SetThreadExecutionState](#windows-stes) Method may now have multiple modes (same or different) activated within the same python thread without them interfering with each other on activation or deactivation, as wakepy creates a *separate worker thread* for the single purpose of setting and keeping the thread execution flag each time you activate a mode with the `SetThreadExecutionState` wakepy.Method. ([#342](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/342))
- Importing wakepy (0.8.0 and 0.9.0) messed up logging. In particular, the logging level was changed to WARNING due to direct call to `logging.debug()` instead of `logger.debug()`. ([#344](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/344)). Thanks to [@reidswanson](https://github.com/reidswanson) for reporting it.
- üë∑ Fixed running the dev command `inv test` on Windows ([#339](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/339), [#341](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/341))

## wakepy 0.8.0
üóìÔ∏è 2024-05-26

### üèÜ Highlights
- This is a basically a complete rewrite of wakepy. It adds support for keep.running mode on Gnome, on-fail action, possibility to control the used methods and their priority, more information about the used methods and the activation process and possibility to exit the mode early. In addition, testing and CI pipelines were updated to ease maintenance.

### ‚ú® Features
- Modes support [on-fail actions](#on-fail-action) ("error", "warn", "pass" or a callable). ([#182](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/182))
- It is now possible to [select the used wakepy.Methods](#how-to-white-or-blacklist-methods) with `methods` and  `omit` and to [change the priority order](#how-to-control-order-of-methods) of methods with `methods_priority`. ([#75](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/issues/75))
- Added [org.gnome.SessionManager](#org-gnome-sessionmanager) method which adds support for keep.running mode for users with Gnome Desktop Environment. ([#51](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/51), [#138](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/138), [#278](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/278), [#282](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/282))
- {class}`ActivationResult <wakepy.ActivationResult>` objects ([#57](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/57), [#258](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/258), [#270](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/270)) in {attr}`Mode.activation_result <wakepy.Mode.activation_result>` which give more detailed information about the activation process.
- Possibility to exit from a mode context manager early with {class}`ModeExit <wakepy.ModeExit>`  ([#72](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/72))
- It's now possible to check the active and used method from the Mode instance using the {attr}`Mode.active_method <wakepy.Mode.active_method>` and  {attr}`Mode.used_method <wakepy.Mode.used_method>` ([#268](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/268))
- Added possibility to use any dbus python implementation through the {class}`DBusAdapter <wakepy.DBusAdapter>`. By default uses jeepney through {class}`JeepneyDBusAdapter <wakepy.JeepneyDBusAdapter>`  (See: [#45](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/issues/45))
### üö® Backwards incompatible
- Removed `set_keepawake` and `unset_keepawake functions` and the `keepawake` context manager. These were deprecated in 0.7.0 and are replaced with the new api: {func}`keep.running() <wakepy.keep.running>` and {func}`keep.presenting() <wakepy.keep.presenting>` context managers. ([#85](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/85))
- Renamed the CLI argument `-s, --keep-screen-awake` to `-p, --presentation`. The old ones were deprecated in 0.7.0. ([#179](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/179/))
- If Mode activation fails, raise {class}`ActivationError <wakepy.ActivationError>` by default. Previously there was no "on fail" action, but users needed to check the `result.success` to make sure the activation was successful.
- The org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver based method is not used on keep.running mode. Systems supporting org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver which are not running Gnome will have no keep.running method until it gets implemented. By default wakepy will raise a wakepy.ActivationError if keep.running is used on such system. Either use keep.preseting mode, or wait or provide a PR.
- The [WAKEPY_FAKE_SUCCESS](#WAKEPY_FAKE_SUCCESS) check is done *before* trying any wakepy Methods (previously, it was used when all the tried methods have failed)

### üêû Bug fixes
- The org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver based method is only used in keep.presenting mode. Previously, it was used on keep.running mode on Linux. ([#46](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/issues/46), [#136](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/issues/136))
- Still going to sleep - running Fedora 36 ([#18](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/issues/18))

### üìñ Documentation
- Rewritten the docs ([#193](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/193), [#194](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/194), [#196](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/196), [#197](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/197), [#198](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/198), [#200](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/200), [#244](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/244), [#271](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/271), [#272](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/272), [#285](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/285), [#286](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/286))

### üë∑ Maintenance
- Made the CI tests mandatory for every PR (previously manual) ([#191](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/191))
- 100% test coverage + use branch coverage instead of line coverage + enforce 100% coverage ([#221](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/221), [#222](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/222))
- Run black+isort+ruff also on tests ([#224](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/224))
- Run mypy also on tests + fix the new mypy issues ([#227](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/227))
- Add tests for Python 3.12 and 3.13. Now test all supported versions of python on linux, and oldest and newest supported versions on MacOS and Windows.  ([#160](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/160), [#236](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/236), [#273](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/273))
- Pin docs and tests dependencies ([#220](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/220))
- Build docs in CI tests to prevent breaking docs ([#211](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/211))
- Run tox and pipeline tests against build wheel instead of the source tree ([#231](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/231), [#236](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/236))
- Build both, sdist (tar.gz) and wheel (.whl). 0.7.x had just wheels and <=0.6.x just dist. Start using setuptools-scm and switch from flit to setuptools ([#235](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/235)).

- WakepyFakeSuccess Method ([#152](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/152)) instead of using some custom logic with `WAKEPY_FAKE_SUCCESS`.
- Split package extras: dev, doc, test and check (was: doc, dev) ([#213](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/213)) and start using requirements-*.txt instead of misusing extras ([#228](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/228))
- Ruff: Update from 0.0.270 to 0.3.2 ([#206](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/206)), use `--no-fix` in tox ([#208](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/208)), Stricter ruff rules: W291 ([#209](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/209))
- Black: Update from 23.3.0 to 24.2.0 and reformat ([#217](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/217))
- Isort: Update from 5.12.0 to 5.13.2 ([#218](https://github.com/fohrloop/wakepy/pull/218))

## wakepy 0.7.1 
üóìÔ∏è 2023-06-11

### üêû Bug fixes
- `keep.running` and `keep.presenting` return an object `m` with `success` value of `True`.

## wakepy 0.7.0
üóìÔ∏è 2023-06-11

### ‚ú® Features
- New API: `keep.running()` and `keep.presenting()` context managers. These are currently simple wrappers of the old methods but the internals will be re-written in a future version.
- The context managers now return the result of the action, `m`. Users may check with `m.success` if changing the mode was successful.
- Possibility to fake successful change of mode with `WAKEPY_FAKE_SUCCESS` (for CI / tests).
### üêû Bug fixes
- No exceptions anymore on import-time. All exceptions should be handled now gracefully, and user is informed if switching to a `keep.running` or `keep.presenting` mode failed.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecations
- Old Python API:  The `keepawake()`, `set_keepawake` and `unset_keepwake`. These will be removed in a future version of wakepy. Use `keep.running()`or `keep.presenting()`, instead.
- The `-s, --keep-screen-awake` option of the `wakepy` CLI command. Use `-p, --presentation ` option, instead.
