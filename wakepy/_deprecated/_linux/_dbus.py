"""This module provides dbus-python + libdbus (aka. dbus) based set_keepawake
and unset_keepawake for linux

Requires dbus-python[1] and libdbus (freedesktop reference implementation)
Untested installation instructions[2]: 

    sudo apt install libdbus-glib-1-dev libdbus-1-dev
    python -m pip install dbus-python
    
Note: libdbus has known problems with multi-threaded use! [3]

[1]: https://github.com/freedesktop/dbus-python
[2]: For venvs. Many linux distributions come with pre-installed dbus-python
[3]: https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-python/
