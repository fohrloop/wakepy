Most important functions

activate_using(method:Method) -> MethodUsageResult

Most important classes

ActivationResult
    This is something returned from mode activation task. Contains the summary

MethodUsageResult

    Detailed explanation
    --------------------
    These are the three possible statuses from attempts to use either

    M: Missing implementation
    F: Failed attempt

    There are total of 7 different outcomes (3*3 possibilities, minus two from
    not checking heartbeat if enter_mode fails), marked as
    {enter_mode_outcome}{heartbeat_outcome}; MS means enter_mode() was missing
    implementation and using heartbeat() was successful.

    All the possible combinations which may occur are

    outcome    What to do

     2)  MM    Raise Exception -- the Method is faulty.
