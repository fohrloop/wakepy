methods

Method
* A class which is intended to be subclassed
* The Methods are ways of entering wakepy Modes.

General functions
-----------------
select_methods
    Select Methods from a collection based on a white- or blacklist.

Functions for getting Methods
-----------------------------
get_method
    Get a single method by name
get_methods
    Get multiple methods be name
method_names_to_classes
    Convert multiple method names to Method classes
get_methods_for_mode
    Get Methods based on a Mode name
