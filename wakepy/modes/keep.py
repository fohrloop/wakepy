    """Create a wakepy mode (a context manager) for keeping programs running.

    Properties
    ----------
    1) The system may not go to sleep meaning that programs will continue
       running and can use CPU.
    2) Does prevent only the automatical, idle timer timeout based sleep /
       suspend; Will not prevent user manually entering sleep from a menu, by
       closing a laptop lid or by pressing a power button, for example.
    3) System may still automatically log out user, enable lockscreen
       or turn off the display.
    4) If the process holding the lock dies, the lock is automatically removed.
       There are no methods in keep.running mode which for example would
       perform system-wide configuration changes or anything which would need
       manual reversal.

    Usage
    -----

    ```
    with keep.running() as k:
        if k.failed:
            # fall back or notify user

        # do something that takes a long time.
    ```

    Parameters
    ----------
    methods: list, tuple or set of str
        The names of Methods to select from the keep.running mode; a
        "whitelist" filter. Means "use these and only these Methods". Any
        Methods in `methods` but not in the keep.running mode will raise a
        ValueError. Cannot be used same time with `omit`. Optional.
    omit: list, tuple or set of str or None
        The names of Methods to remove from the keep.running mode; a
        "blacklist" filter. Any Method in `omit` but not in the keep.running
        mode will be silently ignored. Cannot be used same time with
        `methods`. Optional.
    methods_priority: list[str | set[str]]
        The priority order for the methods to be used when entering the
        keep.running mode. You may use this parameter to force or suggest the
        order in which Methods are used. Any methods not explicitly supported
        by the current platform will automatically be unused (no need to add
        them here). The format is a list[str | set[str]], where each
        string is a Method name. Any method within a set will have equal
        user-given priority, and they are prioritized with the automatic
        prioritization rules. The first item in the list has the highest
        priority. All method names must be unique and must be part of the
        keep.running Mode.

        The asterisk ('*') can be used to mean "all other methods"
        and may occur only once in the priority order, and cannot be part of a
        set. If asterisk is not part of the `methods_priority`, it will be
        added as the last element automatically.

    dbus_adapter:
        Optional argument which can be used to define a customer DBus adapter.

    Returns
    -------
    keep_running_mode: Mode
        The context manager for keeping a system running.
